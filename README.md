stoogeSort.py will read in an array of integers stored in a
local file called data.txt, with the first value being the number of integers
and the remaining values being the array to be sorted using stooge sort
algorithm.  The sorted array will be stored in a file called stooge.out.  To
run the file, create a file called data.txt containing the
array as described above and place this file in the directory.  Next, run the
programs with the commands python3 stoogeSort.py.
